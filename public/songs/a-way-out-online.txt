A Way Out Online - Willie Cotton
(120 bpm, 3/4 time)

       C               |
Well I know you Knight Riders
          F             C 
Are gonna play you some cricket
       C          |
And if I know Umeshkumar
      G            |
He'll take all ten wickets
      C              |
We'll watch the live stream
        F          |
From my home in Redwood
          C        |
And we'll use a computer to
G               C
Send for what's good

CHORUS:
  C   |   F  C
A way out on-line
  |        |               G         |
A thousand miles from what I know as mine
    C
I'm here
    |
I'm there
    F    C 
I'm everywhere
     |          |             G      C
I'll never come home cuz I'm already here

This texting is taxing
Let's video chat
You can tell me the news
You can show me the cat
The neighbors next door
Got a place by the sea
But you still keep in touch
With activity streams

CHORUS

Faces from high school
Still staring at me
But now I know more
About what they believe
The girls are all mothers
And they've got different names
The boys necks are fatter
But their eyes look the same

CHORUS

Starcraft, Star Trek
And *.gif
Or downloading 
An 8 megabyte tiff
Like a pirate, a sailor
I sail those seas
Living on limes and tonics
And movies for free
