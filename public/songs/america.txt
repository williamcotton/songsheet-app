INTRO

Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together

I've got some real estate here in my bag
Em7                      A7             Em7           A7
  So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
    D      C      G         C  C/B  Am  G  F | Fsus4 F 
And walked off to look for America

Kathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
C        C/B          Am              Am
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
G
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
D    G       D        Cmaj7    C
I've gone to look for America
 
BRIDGE:
Bbmaj7                          Cmaj7
   Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
Bbmaj7                                       Cmaj7
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
Fmaj7                                    C  C/B  Am  G  Am/F# F
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera
 
C         C/B       Am              Am/G      F        Fsus4 F
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
C             C/B         Am        Am
We smoked the last one an hour ago
Em7                  A7           Em7          A7
  So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
        D    C    G       C C/B Am  G  F  Fsus4 F
And the moon rose over an o-pen field
 
C         C/B    Am            Am/G         F        Fsus4 F
Kathy I'm lost I said though I knew she was sleeping
    C         C/B        Am               Am
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
G
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
        D   G       D         Cmaj7
They've all come to look for America
D   G       D         Cmaj7
All come to look for America
D   G       D         Cmaj7
All come to look for America
